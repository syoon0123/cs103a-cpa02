# cs103a-cpa02: Movie Database & Finder

This app uses a json file from Wikipedia that contains the information from movies that were released from 1900 to 2018. Information about the movie contains the release year, some of the cast, genre, and title of the movie. For many of the older movies, the cast and genre are missing. This data is also stored in a MongoDB Database. Users can log in to create a movie watch list to view at any time.
